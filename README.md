### Usage

`/eval <text>` on the server to evaluate arbitrary Java code. Can only be run by admins.
See instructions on building in the ExamplePlugin repository.  

I do **not** recommend running this on a publically listed server, as anyone with admin access may be able to gain complete control of your system.
